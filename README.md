# What is SmallBoi?
SmallBoi is an early concept for a Unity game. The overall idea of SmallBoi is to be a fun, stress free, problem solving platform game. We want to challenge our users to solve
problems and cooperate with another player. That's right, another player! Our goal is to allow two players within the same game instance, allowing for double the fun! There will
be a multitude of challenges, enemies and levels to make the game feel less repetative.
